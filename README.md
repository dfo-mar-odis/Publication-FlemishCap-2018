# Publication-FlemishCap-2018
The project "Characterization of Ocean Current Variability and  Dispersion in the Vicinity of Sackville spur" was funded by the Environmental Studies Research Fund. This project supported  activities of petroleum exploration related to the C-NLOPB  Significant Discovery Licences 1047 and 1048 by statoil Canada Ltd.  and Husky. The main objective of this project was to fill a knowledge  gap of moored current meter, temperature, and salinity records in  the vicinity of northern Sackville spur and northwest Flemish Cap.  Filling this gap will resolve timescale variability of physical  oceanographic conditions which can aid in understanding the likely transport and fate of hydrocarbon spills in the area.
